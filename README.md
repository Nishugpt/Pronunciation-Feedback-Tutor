# Pronunciation-Feedback-Tutor
this is my first project
This is basically useful for singers and aspirants preparing for interviews.


Here is a brief, impactful version of MY Project :

üó£Ô∏è Pronunciation Feedback Tutor
A self-guided, fully front-end web application built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript to help users improve their language pronunciation. It leverages the Web Audio API and Web Speech API for real-time practice and analysis.

Core Features
Real-Time Visualization: Displays a Frequency Spectrum using the Web Audio API during user recording, providing immediate visual feedback on sound and pitch.

Custom Reference Audio: Users can upload their own native audio sample and specify exact start and end times to loop and practice difficult segments.

Persistent History: Stores all user recordings and the native reference audio locally using IndexedDB, making practice history available across sessions.

Speech-to-Text Check: Uses the Web Speech API to transcribe the user's voice for a direct, automated check of pronunciation accuracy.

Reference Text Upload: Allows uploading a .txt file to display the target practice text.

Why This Project is Unique
This project offers an integrated, powerful pronunciation tool without relying on any back-end servers or proprietary cloud services. All analysis, storage, and feedback are handled directly in the browser, demonstrating a robust application of modern browser APIs for educational purposes.
